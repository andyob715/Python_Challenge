## PyBank

### Approach

I spent several hours overcomplicating things on my approach to start before working with Svitlana to frame the approach.
Once Svitlana helped me compartmentalize each separate calculation it helped significantly.

### Challenges

Biggest challenge was just picking the right approach. I went down the function route, which didn't work, I tried list comprehensions off the bat, but I hadn't set the data in a workable state.
I think this is just part of the growing pains of learning a new skill.

## PyPoll

### Approach

I first set aside the candidates column so that I could just use that. It seemed like the other two columns were superfluous to my needs for this.
Once I had had the candidates separated, I used a counter to get the specific results. I hadn't used a counter before, but it seemed like it fit my needs.

### Challenges

I could not get all of the dictionary values to print out for my Key/Value pairs. For some reason when I started it was giving me just the last one.
I changed the way I arranged the code and it seemed to work, but I still think the way I did it was clugy at best. It gave me the result, but I think it could be optimized.
